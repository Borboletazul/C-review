//C programs need a main function to work
//most of the time your code will be inside this function

//the C program need some Libraries to run 
//in case, using input/output(io) library to run
#include <stdio.h>

//implementing "main.c" function
int main(void){
  
printf("Hello World")

//return 0 shows the machine that the code has no issues
return 0;
  
//if the program got this far and return 0, everything went well  
}

//now we have a working program in C
